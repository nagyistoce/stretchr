== Anatomy of test suites and tests ==

A webdo test suite is a single ruby (`.rb`) file that contains one or more `test` method calls.

=== the `test` method ===

{{{
test "Name your test" do
  # test code
end
}}}

The test method performs a webdo test when run.  Your test code is usually made up of one or more `web do` calls, followed by a number of assertions.

== `web do` commands ==

The `web do`...`end` block allows you to specify a web request to make.  For example, the following code will make a GET request on `http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=webdo`:

{{{
  web do
    get
    url "http://www.google.co.uk/search"
    with_param "q", "webdo"
  end
}}}

=== Methods ===

You can use any one of the four main RESTful HTTP methods:

  * `get`
  * `put`
  * `post`
  * `delete`

The default is `get`.
