#summary Overview of webdo - Ruby RESTful API testing framework

= `webdo` =

== What is `webdo`? ==

We needed a way to test our RESTful API from a totally external point of view.  So we wrote this simple little ruby script that makes it very easy to run real world tests against the real web.

== A simple example? ==

Webdo lets you write tests like this:

{{{
test "Google search for webdo" do
  
  web do
    get
    url "http://www.google.co.uk/search"
    with_param "q", "webdo"
  end
  
  assert_success
  assert_response_contains "webdo"
  
end
}}}

=== and the output ===

{{{

..
Tests:		Total: 2	Success: 2 	Failed: 0	(100% success)
Assertions:	Total: 4	Success: 4	Failed: 0	(100% success)
}}}
