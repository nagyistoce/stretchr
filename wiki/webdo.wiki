#summary Overview of webdo - Ruby RESTful API testing framework

== What is `webdo`? ==

We needed a way to test our RESTful API from a totally external point of view.  So we wrote this simple little ruby script that makes it very easy to run real world tests against the real web.

== A simple example? ==

Webdo lets you write tests like this:

{{{
test "Google homepage mentions 'Google'" do
  
  web do
    get
    url "http://www.google.com/"
  end
  
  assert_success
  assert_response_contains "Google"
  
end
}}}
