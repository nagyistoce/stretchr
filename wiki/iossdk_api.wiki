#summary API for Stretchr iOS SDK

== Tutorial: Using the Stretchr iOS SDK ==

=== Setting your `key` and `secret` ===

In order to authenticate with Stretchr, you must set your account name, key and secret.  This can be done once, usually in your AppDelegate.

{{{
[[SRContext currentContext] setAccountName:@"your-account-name" key:@"your-key" secret:@"your-secret"];
}}}

`your-account-name` - The name of your account (the subdomain part in `x.xapi.co`)

`your-key` - Your unique key provided by Stretchr

`your-secret` - Your secret string provided by Stretchr

=== Creating a new resource ===

We are going to create a new resource to hold users feedback.  We do not need to define anything, instead we can just save our first resource when we need to:

{{{
SRResource *resource = [[SRResource alloc] initWithPath:@"/feedback"];
[resource setParameterValue:@"John" forKey:@"name"];
[resource setParameterValue:@"I love this service" forKey:@"comment"];
[resource save];
}}}
